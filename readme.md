# DDD-TW PHP Laravel Coffee Shop Sample

## Introduction

This is a Laravel Domain-Driven Design demo project. I'm taking a C# coffee shop project as a reference from [DDDTW.CoffeeShop](https://github.com/ArthurChang01/DDDTW.CoffeeShop).
Checking out the C# project if you want to see more details about the concept.

## Installation

```$ composer install```

## Before you start

I'm using Mongo DB in this project. Preparing a Mongo DB first if you want to run this project. The setting is configured in the .env file.

## How to run service

Just typing one line in your console

```
./artisan serve
```
