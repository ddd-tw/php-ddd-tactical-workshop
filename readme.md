# DDD-TW PHP Laravel Coffee Shop Sample

## Introduction

This is a Laravel Domain-Driven Design demo project. I'm taking a C# coffee shop project as a reference from [DDDTW.CoffeeShop](https://github.com/ArthurChang01/DDDTW.CoffeeShop).
Checking out the C# project if you want to see more details about the concept.

## Installation

```$ composer install```

## Running unit tests

```bash
php <Project>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit --configuration <Project>/phpunit.xml <Project>/tests/Unit
```
